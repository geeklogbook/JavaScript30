# JavaScript30 Solutions

In this repository you'll find my own solutions to the Javascript Challenges. The solutions are not equal to the ones you can see in the download file. So, you can se my interpretation of the solution, however I've followed the idea of taking the same functionalities.

I've also change the sctructure of the solution:
- I've added a stylesheet for all the solutions
- I've added the scripts in a different file.
- I've created a demo landing page.
